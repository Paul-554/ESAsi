# DEPRECATED: HBEN (Hierarchical Bayesian Entanglement Networks)

## Sunset Notice
**This protocol has entered maintenance mode** as we develop its next-generation successor. HBEN remains available for academic and research use under [MIT License].

## Why HBEN is Frozen

### Theoretical Evolution
- Recognized limitations in cross-scale modeling
- New mathematical frameworks show superior spectral coherence
- Emerging architectures better handle non-ergodic systems

### Practical Considerations
| Aspect          | HBEN Status       |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Active Development | ❌ Frozen     |
| Critical Bugs   | ✅ Will fix      |
| New Features    | ❌ Not planned   |
| Research Use    | ✅ Encouraged    |

### Future Directions
Our team is currently:
- Developing more advanced hierarchical architectures
- Researching novel entanglement operators
- Building on HBEN's core innovations

A successor protocol will be released after rigorous validation (est. 2025).

## When To Use HBEN
This implementation remains valuable for:
- Educational purposes in Bayesian ML
- Baseline comparisons in anomaly detection research
- Specialized applications requiring its exact formulation
