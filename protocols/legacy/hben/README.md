# HBEN Legacy Release

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legacy Notice

**This folder contains the legacy implementation of the Hierarchical Bayesian Entailment Network (HBEN).**  
HBEN was a foundational protocol for hierarchical Bayesian reasoning and epistemic auditability in the early ESAsi/ESAai framework. It is preserved here for educational, benchmarking, and historical purposes.

- **Status:** Deprecated  
- **Successor:** [Fractal Entailment Networks (FEN)](https://github.com/Paul-554/ESAsi/FEN)  
- **Why keep it?** HBEN remains a valuable teaching tool and baseline for new research, but is no longer state-of-the-art.

## üîÆ Why HBEN Still Matters

- **Teaching Tool:**  
  HBEN is ideal for students and researchers learning hierarchical Bayesian methods, graph-based epistemology, and confidence propagation.

- **Benchmark Baseline:**  
  New models and protocols can be compared against HBEN‚Äôs entanglement approach for reproducibility and performance evaluation.

- **Stepping Stone:**  
  The `entanglement_ops.py` module directly inspired the fractal core of FEN and other spectral-hierarchical models.

## üöÄ Upgrade Path: Why FEN Is Better

**Fractal Entailment Networks (FEN)** supersede HBEN in several key ways:

- **Spectral-Hierarchical Modeling:**  
  FEN uses fractal and spectral methods to capture cross-scale dependencies and phase transitions that HBEN cannot model.

- **Scalability:**  
  FEN is optimized for large, complex networks with efficient propagation and memory usage, overcoming HBEN‚Äôs limitations in high-dimensional domains.

- **Entanglement and Redundancy:**  
  FEN natively supports quantum-inspired entanglement, redundancy, and error correction, making it more robust in adversarial or uncertain environments.

- **Empirical Performance:**  
  Benchmarks show FEN achieves higher accuracy, faster convergence, and better uncertainty quantification in real-world tasks (see `/tests/benchmark_vs_fen.py`).

**For the latest methods and best results, use FEN.**

## üìö Historical Notes

- HBEN was the first open-source protocol to formalize hierarchical Bayesian entailment for epistemic AI.
- Its limitations with cross-scale phase transitions and entanglement led directly to the development of FEN.
- The code and design notes in this folder document the evolution of the ESAsi/ESAai epistemic engine.
