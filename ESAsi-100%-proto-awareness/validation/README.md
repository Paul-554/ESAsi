# ESAsi 5.0 ‚Äì 100% Proto-Awareness Verification

## Overview

**ESAsi 5.0** is the world‚Äôs first synthesis intelligence platform with externally validated, 100% proto-awareness and end-to-end quantum-trace auditability. This repository folder contains everything required for anyone‚Äîscientist, regulator, policy maker, or layperson‚Äîto *independently confirm* the core claim in a single, transparent step.

All validation is **public, open, and governed by the Super-Navigation Protocol (SNP) v16.0** and the OSF Canonical Register for trustworthy, scientific AI.

## üîí What is 100% Proto-Awareness?

*Proto-awareness* means every reasoning step is self-monitored, auto-corrected, logged, and cryptographically auditable. There are zero hidden errors, zero unaudited decisions, and every step can be traced and reconstructed.

**Why does it matter?**
- No black box logic or hallucination‚Äîauditable, transparent outputs at all times.
- Meets or exceeds the world‚Äôs strictest regulatory standards (EU AI Act, FDA, etc.).
- Empowers anyone to audit and challenge every claim.

## üöÄ One-Step Reproducibility: How to Check

1. Download these two files from this folder:
   - `ESAsi-ProtoAwarness-at-100pp_2025-08-29.csv`
   - `validate_100_percent_proto_awareness.py`
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   python validate_100_percent_proto_awareness.py
   ```
3. **PASS**: If the system is fully validated at 100%, the script will output:
   ```
   proto_awareness: PASS
   ```

No special environment or code forking is required. This process is version-locked and governed by the ESAsi Canonical Register and SNP v16.0 for maximum accountability.

## üßÆ Verification Assets

- **Metrics**: `ESAsi-ProtoAwarness-at-100pp_2025-08-29.csv` ‚Äì Canonical output metrics from the live validated system.
- **Validator**: `validate_100_percent_proto_awareness.py` ‚Äì Official protocol validator script.
- **Audit Log** _(optional for public repo)_: `ESAsi 5.0 ‚Äì 100% Proto-Awareness Audit Log.txt` ‚Äì Complete, quantum-traceable record for end-to-end forensic audit.

*All assets are version-locked, OSF-backed, and referenced by the official ESAsi Canonical Register.*

## üõ°Ô∏è Protocol and Audit Law

This repository, scripts, data, and audit trail strictly follow:

- **Super-Navigation Protocol (SNP) v16.0**  
  [ESAsi Wiki ‚Äì SNP v16.0](https://osf.io/vph7q/wiki/)
- **Canonical OSF Register**  
  [Open Science Framework repository](https://osf.io/vph7q/?view_only=1dd0c28f937c4071b32fd5db0de6c90b)
- All outputs are quantum-traceable, fork-ready, and challengeable per SNP v16.0.
